**[[First Anglo Mysore War]]**
Nizam was involved in alliance with the Marathas (under Peshwa Madhav Rao) in fear of [[Haider Ali]]'s expansion. Even state of Carnatic was doubtful of [[Mysore]], hence the Nawab of state Carnatic (Muhammed Ali Khan Wallajah) allied with [[British]] against Haider Ali leading to the **First Anglo-Mysore war**

The [[Maratha]]s, in anticipation of war between Nizam and Haider attacked Mysore in 1767 (DoG SheiKh) , they withdrew after receiving a payment of 30 Lakhs.

By the time Marathas withdrew, the Nizam with the help of English attacked mysore. But when the English came to know that the Nizam was negotiating peace, they withdrew.

Haider Ali charged on retreating [[British]] and reached till [[Madras]] where the British signed a treaty to limit losses called [[Treaty of Madras]] in 1769 (DoG SheeP), soon the British renegaded from keeping their end of the treaty which lead to **Second Anglo-Mysore war**

**[[Second Anglo Mysore War]]**
The second war took place between 1780-[[1784]] (KFC CoVeR), Haider was in alliance with Marathas and the Nizam, he even managed to capture Arcot (Carnatic).  Haider died in the course of war and passed the legacy to [[Tipu Sultan]], the war ended with a truce and [[Treaty of Mangalore]] was signed in 1784. All territories taken were restored.

**[[Third Anglo Mysore War]]**
The growing power of [[Tipu Sultan]] alarmed [[Maratha]] and the [[Nizam of Hyderabad]] who allied against mysore, but were defeated which led them to seek [[British]] [[Cornwallis]] help. British also had a reason as a Maharaja under their protection was attacked by Tipu, hence British allied with the others and attacked [[Mysore]] in 1790(gypsy). The war ended with treaty of Seringapatanam in 1792(Cabin)

**[[Fourth Mysore War]]**
The [[Fourth Mysore War]] 1799(KeBaB) resulted in [[British]] conquering [[Mysore]] and the death of [[Tipu Sultan]].
[[British]] and [[Wellesley]] wanted a solution to the growing concern of Mysore, after death of [[Tipu Sultan]] a succesor of the Wodeyar family was made to sign the [[Subsidiary Alliance System]] which made Mysore a dependency of [[East India Company]]. The company even took back the districts Mysore had given to the [[Nizam of Hyderabad]] in 1800

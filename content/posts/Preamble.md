The philosophy of the [[Constitution]] is found in the preamble, it was first introduced by [[JL Nehru]] in the [[Objective Resolution]] and passed by [[Constituent Assembly]] on 22 Jan [[1947]]

The preamble was amended in [[42nd amendment of 1976]] (RuNe)(BooKiSH) whereby the words "Socialist", "Secular", "Integrity" was added.

It is non Justiciable

In **Beruberi vs Union case (1960)** SC held that the preamble was not a part of the constitution hence cannot be amended, but later in **Kesavananda Bharati vs state of Kerala(1973)** SC overruled its previous judgement and stated that preamble is a part of the constitution, hence subject to amending power like any other subject.

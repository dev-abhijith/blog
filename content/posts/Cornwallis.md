**Permanent Settlement of Bengal 1793**
Considered as the greatest achievement of Cornwallis, he restructured the land tax. Under [[Mughal]] tax was collected from zamindars who in turn collected it from peasants, but the [[East India Company]] had changed it to be collected directly from peasants through company officials, which lead to wide spread corruption and the peasants suffered.
Cornwallis took the system back to the [[Mughal]] system whereby zamindars were **permanently** given legal ownership of land from which tax had to be collected, 90 percent of which had to be paid to the [[British]]
Though the immediate effects were not good due to the onset of famine and zamindars couldn't collect tax since farmers fled the country, at the beginning of 1800's people started migrating back and the zamindars became wealthy.

**Cornwallis Code** consisted of following points
- Judicial and revenue matters were separated
- European citizens were brought under jurisdiction
- Government servents were answerable to civil courts in action committed in official capacity
- rule of law was imposed

Cornwallis replaced the old Muslim governing class with Hindu's as zamindars, Thus a new class of moneyed men arose.

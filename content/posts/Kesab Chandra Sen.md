In 1858 [[Kesab Chandra Sen]] was made Acharya of the [[Brahmo Samaj]], Under his leadership the organisation spread outside [[Bengal]] to united provinces, but his ideas of 'inter caste' marriages led to division within the Samaj hence, Sen along with some of his followers started [[Brahmo Samaj of India]] in 1866(ToFee haShiSh)  and the old Brahmo Samaj was now called Adi Brahmo Samaj and headed by [[Debendranath Tagore]]. 

In 1878 he married his 13 year old daughter to a Maharaja who was also underage hence was criticised by some of his followers who went on to start [[Sadharan Brahmo Samaj]]. 

He also founded [[Prarthana Samaj]] in 1863(ViSHaM) in [[Bombay]] for the following
- Supporting widow Remarriage 
- Women's education
- Raising minimum permissible age for marriage for both genders
- against caste system

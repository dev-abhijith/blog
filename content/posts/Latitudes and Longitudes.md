**Tropic of cancer** *23 degree 30 minutes North* is the maximum latitudinal limit the sun's position shifts during the **summers solstice**

**Summers solstice** is the time when sun is above the horizon for maximum amount of time, it happens generally on **21 June** on the northern half and **21 december** in the southern half

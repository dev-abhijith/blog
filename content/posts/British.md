English were comparitively late, hence received competition from [[Portugese]] and [[Dutch]]. They came in search of spices.

The East India Company was formed under the patronage of a group of merchants called 'Merchant Adventurers'

East India company gains royal charter from queen Elizabeth to trade exclusively in the east India in 1600, the company opened a factory in Surat in 1608 (Joseph) and Masulipattanam in south India in 1611. The company rulers intimidated and bribed local rulers and gained more control in south mainly due to fall of the [[Vijayanagara]] empire

British benefited from the chaos in the south and decided to move to [[Madras]] **Fort St George**, a Maharaja gave them permission to fortify their forts and mint their own coin and administer it for half a share in customs revenue

Captain Hawkins went to [[Mughal]] emperor [[Jahangir]] for permission to open factories along the west coast, this was extended to the whole Mughal empire when Thomas Roe approached the mughals in 1615, hence more factories were established at Surat, Broach, Ahmedabad, Masaulipatanam

British gaining political power caused confrontation between Mughals, when they seized Hugli and declared war on the Mughals in 1686, they were defeated badly and were evacuated from forts, they later paid [[Aurangzeb]] 1,50,000 and resumed their activities.

In 1698 they gain zamindari of three villages Sutanati, Kalikata, Govindpur and built **Fort Williams** to surround the factory ( later came to be known as [[Calcutta]]).
The Nawabs of Bengal shortly after the death of [[Aurangzeb]], such as [[Murshid Quli Khan]] and [[Alivardi Khan]] were strong and exercised control over British and their fortifications, so the British could only create a stronghold in the south were there were no strong leadership.

The British attacked the French and defeted them at the [[Battle of Chandranagore]], the loss of French infuriated the Nawab of Bengal

The [[Dutch]] and [[British|English]] engaged in constant conflict and finally, the Dutch gave up struggle for Indian trade in return for English giving up Indonesia, Finally there remained [[French]] and English

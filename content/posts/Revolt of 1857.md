- British rule led to strain in the socio-religious fabric through policies which banned child marriage, banning sati, and widow remarriage act. The conservative hindus turned hostile towards [[British]]
- Rumours of bone dust used in military cantonements
- Immediate cause was rumour of presence of pig and cow fat in enfield rifle cartridges which were required to be bitten before usage.

### Economic causes
- British policies were directly responsible for breakdown of the village system 
- The increased tax burden on peasants through new zamindari system, even zamindars lost their lands due to exhorbitant taxes
- Artisans were not able to make a good living as the market flooded with cheaper european goods and royal houses were made mere pensioners stopping any patronages.

### Revolt
During a firing drill sepoys were forced to use the enfield cartridge with pig and cow fat, 85 of 90 did not. They were court marshalled and sentenced for 10 years. The next day revolt began with sepoys killing every British officer including women and children, the rebels set out for Delhi during the night to call upon **Bahadur Shah II in Red Fort** to lead the rebellion. Once he consent to the lead the revolt, he was declared the emperor of India and became a symbol of the revolt.

Entire [[Bengal]] rose up in revolt, but Sikhs stayed away due to the sour history between them and [[Mughal]]s. 

### Leaders and Centres of Revolt
- Bahadur Shah II  - Delhi - he was only a nominal head and the weakest link in the leaders
- General Bhakt Khan - Delhi
- **Nana Saheb** - Kanpur - Adopted son of the last Peshwa, Baji Rao II, banished from Poona by the British
- Rani Laxmi Bhai - Jhansi - Dalhousie annexed Jhansi using Doctrine of Lapse not giving her adopted son the title

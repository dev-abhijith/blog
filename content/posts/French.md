French East India company was established in 1664, among their factories were Pondicherry, Chandranagore (near [[Calcutta]]), British and French clashed whenever war broke out between Britain and French

**First [[Anglo French war]]**
Even though war ended drawn, it was memorable, for the battle of st. thome between the French and Anwar-ud-din of carnatic for the custody of Madras ended with the small trained French army defeating the large Indian army, which gave confidence to Europeans for India's conquest

**Second Anglo French war**
The French Gov-gen [[Dupleix]] started taking sides in internal feuds to gain trust and grants, Dupleix used the chaotic state in Hyderabad and Carnatic to carry out his plans. The French supported Chanda sahib and Muzzafer Jung who won the battle and drove out Muhammed Ali(son of Anwar-ud-din) and Nasir Jung who were supported by the British. But amidst the struggle [[Robert Clive]] attacked Arcot, the capital of Carnatic state and captured it, though the French retaliated, they suffered defeat. The war ended in a settlement(1754) whereby Dupleix was to be recalled from [[India]]. This proved to be fatal for the French aspirations in India.

**Third Anglo French war**
The truce was short lived as there was the outbreak of the *seven years war* in 1757 (tug lock) but the scales were tipped in favour of the british as they had acquired enormous wealth in [[Bengal]] hence the British end up the winner of the battle at **wandiwash** the French colony at Chandranagore was sacked by [[Robert Clive]] (just before the [[Battle of Plassey]]). 

**Anglo French wars** were also called [[Carnatic wars]]

Battle of wandiwash fought in 1760 ended up as a decisive win for the English. The French signed the **Treaty of paris** and were given back Pondicherry and factory at Chandranagore, but they were to remain a mere trading entity under protection of [[British]].

**[[First Anglo Maratha War]]**
The Internal struggle for power between Maratha's made it easy for [[British]] to interfere in their affairs.

Peshwa Sawai Madhav Rao (supported by Nana Phadnavis) and Ex-Peshwa Raghunath Rao (supported by British) were the main factions, the British marched from [[Calcutta]] to [[Ahmedabad]] winning battles but eventually ended with the [[Treaty of Salbai]] in 1782(CoFFiN)

Peace was restored with the treaty, [[British]] managed to regain the lost territories from [[Haider Ali]] by making the Marathas exert pressure on [[Mysore]] Isolating the state of Mysore, which turned the tide in favour of British which led to the [[Third Anglo Mysore War]]

**[[Second Anglo Maratha War]]** 1803-1805
[[Wellesley]]'s aggressive policy towards internal affairs of Marathas was based on his desire to impose [[Subsidiary Alliance System]] on them, but he was unsuccessful due to strong leaders, by the end of eighteenth century all of them were dead and Peshwa Baji Rao II fled to Bassein due to internal conflicts. Eying the oppurtunity [[British]] made him sign the [[Subsidiary Alliance System]] in 1802 and he was restored to throne with British troops protection.

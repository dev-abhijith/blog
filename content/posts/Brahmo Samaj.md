[[Brahmo Samaj]]
Brahmo samaj was named for the veneration towards the lord 'Brahma', aimed at purifying the evil practices of hinduism and leading to monotheism. After the death of Ram Mohan Roy the organisation was headed by [[Debendranath Tagore]] who also founded [[Tattvabodhini Sabha]](1839 - TV MaP) but the organisation fell apart soon after his death. 

In 1858 [[Kesab Chandra Sen]] was made Acharya of the Samaj, Under his leadership the organisation spread outside [[Bengal]] to united provinces, but his ideas of 'inter caste' marriages led to division within the Samaj hence, Sen along with some of his followers started [[Brahmo Samaj of India]] in 1866(ToFee haShiSh)  and the old Brahmo Samaj was now called Adi Brahmo Samaj and headed by [[Debendranath Tagore]]. 

In 1878 he married his 13 year old daughter to a Maharaja who was also underage hence was criticised by some of his followers who went on to start [[Sadharan Brahmo Samaj]].

Intentended to address the shortcomings of [[Regulating Act of 1773]] by making East India Company accountable to [[British]] government

The Act stated the governing council formed (6 members) would henceforth "superintend, direct and control" the company's posession, in effect controlling acts, civil and military operations, revenue etc.

The Governing council was reduced to 3 members, Governors of [[Bombay]] and [[Madras]] was stripped of their independence, the Governor General was to be a Crown appointee

By the supplementary act,[[Cornwallis]] became the second Gov-Gen of [[Bengal]] hence became the effective ruler of India under the court of directors and board of control, the constitution set up by Pitts India act did not undergo major change until independence.

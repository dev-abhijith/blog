Area drained by a river and its tributaries is called a **drainage system**
A river drains water collected from specific area called **cachement** area, cachement area of small rivers are called **watershed**

River **Ganga** has the largest drainage basin in [[India]], the largest drainage basin in the world belongs to Amazon

Drainage systems are classified into two:
 1) Peninsular Drainage system - seasonal, only rainwater, short course, shallower
 2) Himalayan Drainage system - Perennial, recieve rainwater and form glaciers, long course, deeper due to intensive erosional activity in the upper courses

#### Himalayan Rivers
##### [[Indus]]
Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Beas, Satluj

Indus water treaty 1960(chess) - treaty brokered by World bank, according to the treaty Ravi, Satluj, Beas belong to India and 20 percent of the water of Indus also belong to India. Indus, Jhelum and Chenab are to be taken care of by Pakistan.
It is the most successful water treaty in the world, it has withstood wars and pakistan insurgency.

Beas - is the only river in the Indus river sytem which entirely flows in India

Satluj - Nathpa Jhakri is the countries largest hydroelectric project

##### [[Ganga ]] 
Ganga originates as **Bhagirathi** from Gangotri glacier, in Uttarakashi district of Uttarakhand. Alakananda originating from Badrinath joins it at Devaprayag.
Ganga flows through Haridwar and to Allahabad where it is joined by Yamuna near Rajmahal Hills, turns south-east and bifurcates at Farakka into Bagirathi-Hugli in West Bengal as Padma

The arcuate delta of Ganga and Brahmaputra is the worlds largest delta of 400 km.
The delta is made up of distributaries and islands and is covered by dense forest called the **Sunderbans**, a major part of the delta is comprised of swamp which floods during high tide.

Ganga is Inland waterway no.1 from Allahabad to Kolkata and Haldia port

<u>Yamuna</u>
Yamuna is the largest and most important tributary of Ganga, the major tributaries of Yamuna are: **Tons, Hindon, Chambal, Sind, Betwa, Ken**

<u> Damodar </u>
Sorrow of Bengal

<u>Kosi</u>
Sorrow of Bihar

Namamai Gange programe - clean and protect Ganga river

##### [[Brahmaputra]]
- It rises in Chemayungdung glacier in Kailas range of Himalayas.
-  Indus and Sutlej also originates from nearby Mansarovar
- With total length of 2500 km it is the longest rivers of the world
- It forms a Grand Canyon like structure in Tibet called Namcha Barwa mountains
- It is called Tsangpo in Tibet 
- It forms the largest riverine Island of the world called **Majuli**
- Brahmaputra is navigable until Dibrugarh. It is recognised as National Waterway no.2
- Brahmaputra joins with Tista in Bangladesh afterwards it is called Jamuna. The Jamuna Ganga confluence is called Padma.

#### Peninsular Rivers
Older and more mature than Himalayan rivers, devoid of meanders and have almost fixed course, may even dry up during summers. 
The present peninsular drainage system is a cause of 2 factors, submergence of western flanks of peninsula leaving just the upper part of the west flowing rivers above the sea level, the second is the creation of fault through Narmada and Tapi during the upheaval of Himalayas

They can be classified into 3 types 
- Draining into Bay of Bengal (South East) - Mahanadi, Godavari, Krishna, Cauvery...
- Draining into Arabian Sea (Westwards) - Narmada and Tapi
- Tributaries of the Ganga river system flowing in North-eastery direction

### East flowing rivers of peninsula
 **[[Mahanadi]]** - [[Hirakut Dam]] on the river has reduced the flood intensity
 **[[Godawari]]** - Largest River system of the peninsular
 **[[Krishna]]** - Second largest east flowing river, [[Koyna]], [[Thungabadra]], [[Nagarjunasagar]], are important dams across Krishna river system
 **[[Kaveri]]** -

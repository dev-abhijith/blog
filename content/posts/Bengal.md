The **Royal Farman of 1717** allowed the company Duty free trade in bengal and permits for such goods, company servants could also trade, but were not extended the farman.
The government under [[Murshid Quli Khan]] saw loss of revenue because of the farman hence the company was required to deposit a lumpsum to the treasury.
The company also misused dastak(exempt from paying customs duty)

[[Alivardi Khan]] also paid close attention to the actions of British and their rivalry with French, he did not let the British fortify their settlements.

When [[Siraj-ud-daula]] ascended the throne differences with english arose, mainly due to 1) misuse of dastak 2) imposition of heavy customs duty on Indians for trade through Calcutta port 3) English gave shelter to a fugitive prince from Siraj-ud-daula 4) The **main** reason was however _Fortification of [[Calcutta]]_ in anticipation of Anglo-French rivalry French stopped fortification but the English did not.
Acting immediately to secure his interest, the Nawab seized the English factory at kazimbazar and marched towards [[Calcutta]] and secured [[Fort Williams]] (Black hole incident) on june 1756 the British fled from the fort and took shelter in an Island( In Hugli ) due to their strong naval force

Soon reinforcements arrive in the form of Admiral Watson and colonel [[Robert Clive]] who dislodged Nawab's men with ease and took back the fort.

The [[Treaty of Alinagar]] was signed with the [[British]] by which the Nawab agreed to restore the companies forts and allow fortification and restore former privilages.

The British attacked the French and defeted them at the [[Battle of Chandranagore]], the loss of French infuriated the Nawab

The [[Battle of Plassey]] was fought on 23 June 1757 (**_tug lock_**). A conspiracy was already hatched to defeat the nawab [[Siraj-ud-daula]] by his leading men, led by Mir Jafar (Military commander).
Thereby **Mir Jafar** was made the new Nawab of Bengal.

The company officials demanded bribes and used the wealth of Bengal for expenses in Madras and Bombay, the wealth was also used to buy goods at cheap from India and export it to other countries thus began India's _drain of wealth_

Mir Jafar was forced to give up the throne for Mir Qasim who showered British with many gifts and favours, but soon he was fed up with the greed and corruption.

Mir Qasim tried to raise an efficient army according to european standards and put an end to corruption. He also tried to end the **farman of 1717**, by removing duties for everyone making Indians equal to British which was not tolerated by the British, this led to a series of wars ending in the defeat of the Nawab, in 1763 Mir Qasim flees to Awadh. Mir Qasim forms an alliance with [[Shuja-ud-daula]] while British restore Mir Jafar as the Nawab of Bengal

The combined forces of Mir Qasim, Shuja-ud-daula, [[Shah Alam II]] fought the British force in the [[Battle of Buxar]] in Oct 1764 (**_tug chor_**). The British defeated the combined army, multiple times larger than themselves due to mutual hostilities in the army.

[[Shah Alam II]] the nawab of awadh had to sign [[Treaty of Allahabad]] with the British in 1765, and he accordingly kept the Nizamat(Civil and Police) of 100 million acres of land (present odisha, Bengal, Bihar) ([[Awadh]]) in return for 2.6 million annual tribute, while Diwani(revenue) was collected by the British. (came to be known as [[Dual Administration of Bengal]])

The company also acquired Kara and [[Allahabad]] and kept the Mughal as a pensioner (proxy so the British crown is unaware of developments and does not interfere and for [[Warren Hastings]] - **Ring of fence policy**) for 6 years until the Marathas escorted him to Delhi.

[[Battle of Buxar]]also led to [[Dual Administration of Bengal]] which cause massive _drain of wealth from India_
